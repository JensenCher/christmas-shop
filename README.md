# Welcome to my Christmas Shop

This project is a series on [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/?ref=JenTypes) which is iCodeMas!

Starting from 1st December 2023, [iCodeMas #01](https://iCodeThis.com/submissions/53219) series.

Ends on 24th December 2023.

I've decided to take the challenge and make it into a Vue Christmas Shop.

This project uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` and TypeScript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
